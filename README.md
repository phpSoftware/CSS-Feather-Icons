CSS Feather Icons
=================

> v4.24.0 (2019-08-08)

__Download [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/feather.zip) 
and run `icon.php` on e.g. localhost. 
It will read SVG icons from the folder `feather` and build css from it.
Save the CSS from the browser as a file and use it without the SVG Icons!__
